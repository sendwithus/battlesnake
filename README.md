## Running Your Own Game Server (With Docker)

This list of steps will work on Mac OS X or on Linux, if you are on Windows please use the vagrant setup.

* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
* Run `docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 sendwithus/battlesnake-server`
* Visit <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a> *NOTE:* Docker runs on a virtual lan so when you add a snake to the game you cannot use localhost, use your internal IP instead.

## Running Your Own Game Server (With Vagrant)

This list of steps will work on Windows/Mac OS X/Linux

* [Install Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* Create a directory somewhere on your computer
* Inside the created directory, create a file named Vagrantfile and save it with the following:

```vagrantfile
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "generic/alpine36"
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3000, host: 3000
  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", disabled: true
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.name = 'Alpine1'
    vb.cpus = 1
    vb.memory = 1024
  end
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    echo http://dl-3.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/main >> /etc/apk/repositories
    echo http://dl-3.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community >> /etc/apk/repositories
    apk update
    apk add docker
    rc-update add docker boot
    service docker start
    sleep 2
    docker run -td -p 3000:3000 sendwithus/battlesnake-server
  SHELL

end
```

* Open a terminal and cd into the created directory
* Run `vagrant up`
  * first time running this command with take a bit because of images that need to be downloaded
* Visit `http://localhost:3000` *NOTE:* The virtual machine runs on a virtual lan so when you add a snake to the game you cannot use localhost, use your internal IP instead.
* `vagrant halt` will stop the virtual machine, and `vagrant destroy` will remove it.

### Can I work on my snake before the event

YES! We highly recommend it.

### How do I collect Bounty Snake prizes?
