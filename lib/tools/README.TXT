I put this together quickly and would do the following to improve it:

./api and ./app
   I wanted to use the exiting local snakes but didn't
   I'd have to modify each of them so that the '_id' is passed/picked up as in environment variable.

There's probably more...but i'm not remembering it at the moment.
